# Parsing Framework: Proof of Concept

## How to run this project:
* Install Nodejs runtime environment: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (I am using version 15.4.0)

* Source the `run.sh` script: 
```
$ source run.sh
```

## How to create the CFG:
* Install graphviz: https://graphviz.org/download/
* Source the `createDot.sh` script:
```
$ source createDot.sh
```
* This will create a .dot file from which a .png file containing a graphical representation of the CFG is created using the graphviz command line utility.
